[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/f3219443a8f5fbecca77/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/dvmonroe/qstash-ruby/maintainability)

A Ruby client for the [QStash](https://upstash.com/qstash) service from Upstash.

QStash is an HTTP-based messaging and scheduling solution, designed for serverless and edge computing environments, guaranteeing at-least-once delivery.

If you're coming from a Rails background, you'll be familiar with ActiveJob, Sidekiq, and/or DelayedJob for background job processing. QStash can run background jobs which may/may not be a use case if you're using Ruby in a serverless environment but it's also much more than that. It can:

- Schedule messages to be delivered at a later time.
- Serve as a FIFO message queue.
- Serve as a push based fanout exchange (think RabbitMQ).

## Getting Started

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'qstash'
```

Setup your thread safe configuration:

```ruby
QStash.configure do |q|
  q.token = "your-qstash-token"
  q.url = "https://qstash.upstash.io"
end
```

or you can set the following ENV variables at runtime:

```bash
QSTASH_TOKEN=your-qstash-token
QSTASH_URL=https://qstash.upstash.io
```

## Messages

#### Publish
To [publish a message](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/api/publish) to a queue:

```ruby
QStash::Message.publish(destination: "https://example.com/api/message-receiver", body: "Hello, World!")
```

From Upstash's docs:

> Destination can either be a topic name or id that you configured in the Upstash console, a valid url where the message gets sent to, or a valid QStash API name like api/llm. If the destination is a URL, make sure the URL is prefixed with a valid protocol (http:// or https://)

You can also pass in headers. We help format Upstash's headers for you if you pass them in:

```
- "Upstash-Method",
- "Upstash-Timeout",
- "Upstash-Retries",
- "Upstash-Callback",
- "Upstash-Failure-Callback",
- "Upstash-Forward-*
- "Upstash-Delay",
- "Upstash-Not-Before",
- "Upstash-Deduplication-Id",
- "Upstash-Content-Based-Deduplication"
```

```ruby
QStash::Message.publish(
  destination: "https://example.com/api/message-receiver",
  body: "Hello, World!",
  headers: { upstash_retries: 2 }
)
```

#### Enqueue

    body: "Hello, World!"
  },
  {
    destination: "https://example.com/api/message-receiver",
    body: "Hello, World Again!",
    headers: { upstash_retries: 2 }
  }
])
```
